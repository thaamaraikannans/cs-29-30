### **Task 1: Student Grade Calculator**
Write a Python script to calculate the grade of a student based on the following criteria:

1. **Input:**
   - Accept a student's name (string).
   - Accept their marks in 3 subjects (integers or floats).

2. **Processing:**
   - Calculate the average of the marks.
   - Determine the grade based on the average:
     - `A` if average ≥ 90
     - `B` if 75 ≤ average < 90
     - `C` if 50 ≤ average < 75
     - `F` if average < 50

3. **Output:**
   - Display the student's name, average marks, and grade.

### **Task 2: Data Extraction and Type Conversion**
You are given the following data in a dictionary:

```python
data = {
    "user": "John Doe",
    "age": "29",
    "marks": [85, 35, 78],
    "is_graduate": "True"
}
```

1. Extract and print:
   - The name in uppercase.
   - The age as an integer.
   - The total of all marks.
   - If any of the mark is below 35, then convert graduate to false
   - Whether the person is a graduate as a boolean.

2. Use type conversion where necessary.

### **Task 3: Find the Largest Even Number**
Write a program to find the largest even number from a list of numbers.
```python
   numbers = [12, 47, 18, 42]
```
1. **Processing:**
   - Use conditionals to find the largest even number in the list.

3. **Output:**
   - Display the largest even number.
